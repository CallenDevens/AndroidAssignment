        fullplot="2015 has been a great year for espionage films. From the beginning of the year, there was Kingsmen: Secret Service. Just this past summer, there was Spy followed by Mission:Impossible - Rogue Nation. All of these were very successful, both commercially and critically. And now, another spy film is gunning to join that illustrious list. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was originally a TV series from the mid-1960s developed by Sam Rolfe. It starred Robert Vaughn (as American agent Napoleon Solo) and David McCallum (as Russian agent Illya Kuryakin). U.N.C.L.E. was an acronym for the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, a secret international counter-espionage organization, aiming to maintain worldwide political and legal order. This series lasted for four years from 1964 to 68, becoming a cultural icon of sorts at that time with its audacious theme of US-Russian cooperation at the height of the Cold War."
